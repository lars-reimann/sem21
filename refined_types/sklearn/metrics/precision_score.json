This is applicable only if targets (y_{true,pred}) are binary.\n\n'micro':\nCalculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives and false positives.\n\n'macro':\nCalculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.\n\n'weighted':\nCalculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). This alters ‘macro’ to account for label imbalance; it can result in an F-score that is not between precision and recall.\n\n'samples':\nCalculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from accuracy_score).\n\n"
